Middleware service for integration GitHub and Crowdin.

Initial implementation MAY be implemented as GitHub application and based on [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) framework. But final decision on technology stack and implementation is up to the working group.

Middleware service will utilize other tools developed in scope of Magento Translation project and final goal is to provide possibility for contributors add translations directly from GitHub and automate packaging and releasing Magento language packages.
